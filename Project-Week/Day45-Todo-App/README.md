# Day 45 Project: To-Do List App (TypeScript)

Build a modern to-do list app using TypeScript, with persistent tasks using local storage.

---

## Objectives
- Add, edit, and delete tasks
- Mark tasks as completed
- Store tasks in local storage
- Use TypeScript for all logic

## Requirements
- `index.html` (UI layout)
- `style.css` (modern, responsive design)
- `main.ts` (TypeScript logic)

## Bonus Features
- Filter tasks (all/active/completed)
- Edit tasks in-place
- Theme switcher

## Getting Started
1. Open the folder in VS Code
2. Run `tsc main.ts` to compile TypeScript
3. Open `index.html` in your browser

**Pro Tip:**
- Use TypeScript interfaces for task objects
- Keep UI and logic separate for maintainability
