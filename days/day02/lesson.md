# Day 2: Basic Types in TypeScript

Today you'll learn about TypeScript's basic types and how to use them for safer, clearer code.

---

## Basic Types
- `string`
- `number`
- `boolean`
- `null` and `undefined`
- `any` (avoid if possible)

## Example Usage
```ts
let username: string = 'Ali';
let age: number = 25;
let isActive: boolean = true;
```

## Type Annotations
- Use `:` to annotate variable types
- TypeScript will catch type errors at compile time

---

## Pro Tip
If you donâ€™t specify a type, TypeScript tries to infer it for you!

---

**Next:** Practice declaring variables with different types in the exercise!
