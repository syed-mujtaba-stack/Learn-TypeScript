# Day 3: Arrays & Tuples

Today you'll learn how to use arrays and tuples in TypeScript for storing collections of values.

---

## Arrays
- Store multiple values of the same type
```ts
let scores: number[] = [90, 85, 88];
let names: string[] = ['Ali', 'Sara', 'John'];
```

## Tuples
- Store a fixed number of elements of specific types
```ts
let person: [string, number] = ['Ali', 30];
```

## Array Methods
- Use `.push()`, `.pop()`, `.map()`, etc., just like in JavaScript

---

## Pro Tip
Use tuples for structured data, like coordinates or key-value pairs.
