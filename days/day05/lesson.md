# Day 5: Type Inference

TypeScript can automatically infer types based on your code, making development smoother and safer.

---

## What is Type Inference?
- TypeScript figures out the type of a variable from its value.

## Example
```ts
let city = 'Lahore'; // inferred as string
let count = 10;      // inferred as number
```

## When to Use Explicit Types?
- When the type isnâ€™t obvious
- For function parameters and return types

---

## Pro Tip
Use explicit types for public APIs and complex structures.
