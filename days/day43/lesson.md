# Day 43: TypeScript Project Structure & Best Practices

Learn how to organize a scalable TypeScript project: folder structure, naming, configuration, and tips for maintainability.

---

## Recommended Structure
```
my-app/
├── src/
│   ├── components/
│   ├── utils/
│   ├── index.ts
├── tests/
├── tsconfig.json
├── package.json
```

## Best Practices
- Use clear folder/module names
- Separate logic (components, utils, services)
- Use interfaces/types for contracts
- Enable strict mode in `tsconfig.json`
- Keep code DRY and modular

---

## Pro Tip
Adopt code formatting tools (Prettier, ESLint) and always keep your types up to date.

**Next:** Practice refactoring and structuring code in the exercise!
